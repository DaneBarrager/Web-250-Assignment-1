Chapter 6  -- Part 2
Assignment 6
Dane Barrager

The solution to the Chapter 6 Parts 1, 2, 3, 4 & 5 exercises can all be found at:

I enhanced Part 3 by adding the following functions:

1. Add Customer
2. Delete Customer

So full Find, Edit, Add, Delete functions are implemented.

I added 2 other capabilities to the Find function:

3. Change the select statement to a LIKE, so you can find a customer just by typing in the 1st part of the name, not the whole name.  If the LIKE query returns no values, then an error is displayed.
4. If no name is entered in the Find box, the Select query returns all customers.
